-51 AH,1 Rabi al Awwal,Sun,Apr 12,571,,42,The Jews of Medina knew about the birth of Prophet,"Abu Saeed al-Khudri narrates from his father Malik bin Sinan (may God be pleased with him) that one day I came to Abd al-Ashhal. In those days we were aloof from war and controversy. I heard Joshua, the Jew, saying that the time of the appearance of this prophet had come, who would named Ahmadﷺ and would appear from the Haram. A person, Khalifa bin Shoalba Ashali, jokingly asked him how he would look like? He explained that his eyes will be red, shall carry a small blanket,  will be  riding on a mule with a sword hanging on his shoulder and Madina shall be his permanent abode.  Malik said that amazed he returned to his people in Banu Khadra. There a man said to me, ``Yushua is not the only one who says so. Every Jew of Yathrab says the same thing.""  From there I came to Banu Quraiza. They were also discussing the same issue. I heard Zubayr bin Bata saying,"" the red star has risen which rises only on the birth of a prophet and there is no prophet left except Ahmadﷺ. This city is his place of migration."" Abu Saeed said that my father narrated the whole story when Messengerﷺ of Allah came to Medina. The prophet ﷺ said that if Zubair (Jew) and other leaders like him converted then all the Jews would follow them.

-51 AH,8 Rabi al Awwal,Sun,Apr 19,571,,49,"Jews in Medina knew about the birth of Prophet Muhammadﷺ. 
","One day before his birth the event was announced publicly. 
Hassan b. Thabit narrates: 'I was a well-grown boy of seven or eight, understanding all that I heard, when I heard a Jew calling out at the top of his voice from the top of a fort in Yathrib ""O company of Jews"" until they all came together and called out ""Confound you, what is the matter?"" He answered: ""Tonight has risen a star under which Ahmad is to be born.""

-51 AH,9 Rabi al Awwal,Mon,Apr 20,571,1,1,"Few bizarre events that happened shortly before and at the time of Prophet Muhammadﷺ blessed birth. 
","When Hazrat Aminah  was suffering from labor pains, a light emanated from her body which illuminated the east and the west, along with it she got relief from labour pains. After that the light came close to her and she felt like this embodied light lifted a handful of clay from the ground and extended it towards her, which Hazrat Amina took in her hand. Then the light turned towards the sky.
The mother of Hazrat Uthman bin Abi Al-Aas (RA) says that she was present at that occasion and she did not see anything there except light, and the stars outside had come so close to the earth that it seemed as if they were about to fall on the earth. 
The mother of Hazrat Abd al-Rahman bin Auf (RA) was performing the services of a midwife at the time of the birth of the Prophet.ﷺ She said that as soon as the blessed infant came to her hands, the entire environment got illuminated.
After his birth his mother conveyed to his grandfather 'Abdu'l-Muttalib that she had given birth to a boy and asked him to come and look at him. Hazrat Umm Ayman (RA) was immediately sent to inform Hazrat Abdul Muttalib about this good news. Hazrat Umm Ayman (RA) was the nun of Hazrat Abdullah. She was married to Zayd bin Haritha, from whom Hazrat Osama bin Zayd was born.
Hazrat Umm Ayman ran to Hazrat Abdul Muttalib with joy and gave him the good news of the birth of the Prophet. They immediately reached home. There, Hazrat Abdul Muttalib was shocked to see the beauty of the Holy Prophet, and then expressed his feelings in a few verses, in which he described the beauty of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, superior to the beauty of ‘Gulman’ and thanked God. When he came, she told him what she had seen when she conceived him and what was said to her and what she was ordered to call him. 'Abdu'l-Muṭṭalib took him to  Ka'ba, where he stood and prayed to Allah thanking him for this gift. Then he brought him out and delivered him to his mother, and he tried to find foster-mothers for him.
Al-Bayhaqi, from various sources, including Hazrat Abbas bin Abdul Muttalib (RA) and his son Hazrat Abdullah Bin Abbas (RA), state that the Prophet (PBUH) was born circumcised, at which Hazrat Abdul Muttalib expressed great joy and wonder.

-51 AH,10 Rabi al Awwal,Tue,Apr 21,571,1,2,"Jew witnessed the seal of Prophethood
","In this regard, the incident of a Jew is strange. Hisham bin Arwah narrates on the authority of his father and Umm al-Mu'minin Hazrat Aisha Siddiqa Tahira, may Allah be pleased with her, that a Jew used to live in Makkah and do business. On the day the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was born, he asked the Quraysh in a meeting on that day.’ Do you know that a great child was born in your nation last night?’ On inquiry, it came to know that a child was born to Hazrat Abdullah, the son of Hazrat Abdul Muttalib, from the womb of Hazrat Amina bint Wahib.
On the request of the Jew, those people took him to the house of Hazrat Abdul Muttalib. When Muhammadﷺ was brought before this Jew, people saw that he was brighter than the blessed moon. Light was appearing from the face and forehead. The Jew opened his back and saw a wart between his shoulders (the seal of prophethood in which there was a row of hair like a horse's mane), he fainted. When he regained consciousness, the people of Quraysh asked him: ""Hey, what happened to you?""
That Jew began to cry and said: ""Today the chain of prophethood has been transferred from us Bani Israel to your nation.""
Then when his health recovered, he congratulated Quraysh for this blessing and said that now this news will spread from east to west.

Uncle Abu Lahab's concubine, Abu Lahab freed her in the joy of the birth of the Prophet (peace be upon him), Hazrat Thuwaibah (RA) had also breastfed his uncle Hazrat Hamza (RA), who was the same age as him, and a few other women also breastfed the Prophet (PBUH)."
